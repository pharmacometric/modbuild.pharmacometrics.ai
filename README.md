# Welcome to the PK/PD Visualizer!

This application helps you visualize, simulate, and generate code for various pharmacokinetic models, including standard and Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD) models.

# How It Works:

### Select a Model: Use the "Model Library" panel to choose a model type and configure its specific structure.

### View Model Details: The "Selected Model" tab provides a textual description of the current model's components and assumptions.

### Customize Diagram & Plot: Use the "Diagram Settings" and "Plot Settings" tabs to customize every aspect of the visuals.

### View Results: The diagram and plot in the center panel update automatically as you make changes.

### Export: Use the right-hand panel to download high-quality images, reproducible code, or model code for NONMEM, Monolix, and R.
